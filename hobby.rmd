Glad to see you press this tag.

Other than Statistics, I also like to study philosophy.

Here is some topic I'm interested in:

[Schopenhauer: On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason and Other Writings](https://iowa-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/12tutg/01IASU_ALMA51324713500002756): a good topic about how to realize the meaning about sufficient reason, which can be viewd as a critic to the Descartes' question about the world and echo back to Aristotle's [Latine Interpretibus Variis](https://iowa-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/11r0uch/TN_cdi_hathitrust_hathifiles_uc1_c15055).
